# Alexa-Pro-type-
The Alexa-Pro-type- Project is a small project to build a program like that of the Amazon's Alexa . 
I imported several libraries from the ever expanding python library to help connect to my microphone and also interpret my speech into words
The alexa program can also tell programming jokes and tell the current time .
The alexa program can also play songs from youtube as well and check who someone is and what things are on google .
